                <p>Adventure Rooms Canada has by far the BEST escape rooms I have ever been to. Every other escape room company you visit after experiencing Adventure Rooms Canada will be a disappointment. The puzzles are innovative, challenging, and amazingly creative, and they leave you thinking about them for days.</p>

                <p>This is a must do in Niagara Falls! The rooms are incredible! We did both Stool Pigeon and The Collector and highly recommend both rooms! As people who have done over 40 escape rooms, this place is one of the best! High quality rooms and puzzles with great immersion! Thank you to the wonderful staff who made our experience even better! We can‚Äôt wait to come back and do your other rooms!</p>

                <p>I cannot express in words as to how much I loved the escape rooms. We were so amazed by the 1st room - ‚ÄúThe Missing Finger‚Äù, we wanted to try out the second room ‚ÄúThe Vault‚Äù, and then we couldn‚Äôt stop ourselves we finally completed all 7 rooms(Both Kitchener and Niagara) in less than 2 weeks. The staff here at both the locations are amazing.</p>
