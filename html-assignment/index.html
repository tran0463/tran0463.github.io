        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I was born in the year 2001. I was born in Kitchener-Waterloo, ON, Canada, but <em>recently</em> moved to Ottawa for the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. Only later did I find out it was all online, but I donâ€™t regret moving though. I love crypto and stocks. I am a computer hardware enthusiast, and am currently waiting for parts to arrive to assemble a new TKL keyboard.</p>

        What would I need to add copyright information for? BTW I made the <a href="http://tran0463.github.io">homepage</a> link to the folder for this assignment.
